## Linked List

### Basics:
A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element, called a *node*, contains two parts:
- **Data**: The value you want to store.
- **Pointer/Link**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

The first node is called the **head**, and the last node points to `null`, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists do not require contiguous memory, making them dynamic and efficient for insertions and deletions compared to arrays.

### Types of Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the head, forming a circle.
