# LeetCode Patterns in JavaScript – My DSA Journey

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my repository where I’m solving and documenting 50+ LeetCode problems focused on essential patterns and arrays, all in JavaScript.

## 🚀 About This Repo

This is my personal space to practice, learn, and grow as a developer by tackling famous LeetCode patterns—like Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Monotonic Stack, Modified Binary Search, and more—using JavaScript as my language of choice.  
I’m actively learning and improving, and this repo is a record of my progress and evolving problem-solving skills.

## 🌱 Why Patterns?

Patterns are the backbone of efficient problem-solving on LeetCode and in real-world interviews.  
By focusing on these, I’m building a toolkit to quickly recognize and solve a wide variety of problems.

## 🛠️ Continuous Learning

This repository is a work in progress!  
I revisit problems to refactor and optimize my solutions as I learn new techniques and deepen my understanding.  
Feedback, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome.

## 💡 Sample Patterns Covered

- **Two Pointers:** Find pairs in sorted arrays, reverse arrays in-place, etc.
- **Sliding Window:** Maximum sum subarrays, longest substring without repeats, etc.
